            <h3>01. About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ikjoon Park. I am a third year Computer Science student at the 
                University of California San Diego. I've had an interest in Computer Science at an 
                early age due to my father's occupation as then the lead animator at Rockstar Studios, a 
                video game publisher. Growing up, I was naturally drawn to videogames and continued 
                this hobby throughout my highschool career. My interest in video games eventually amalgamated
                into a general interest in technology and computer programming, and I chose to pursue this
                academically through an university setting.</p>

            <h3>02. Interests</h3>
            <p>Apart from my passion in computer science/programming and videogames, I am also interested 
                in fashion and building keyboards. Although my interest in fashion is largely financially
                restrained, I have recently completed a 75% keyboard that has become my daily driver. Check
                out the <code>git</code>-themed keycaps from GMK; many of the keys are replaced with common
                <code>git</code> commands like <code>tag, push, checkout,</code> and <code>fetch</code>!
            </p>

            <button onclick = "SomeFunction()"> Show keyboard</button>
            <template>
                <h4>My Recent Keyboard Build!</h4>
                <img src = "keyboard.jpg" alt = "Custom keyboard" width = "600">
            </template>
            <script>
                /* script that displays the picture of the keyboard when the 
                button is pressed, calling SomeFunction().
                */
            </script>
